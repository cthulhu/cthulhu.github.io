Last months there was a lot of noise around bitcoin topic. Personally I have purely technical and philosophic interest about that topic. Bitcoin is a phenomen. To be honest a lot of people still don't really understand importance of it for a progress. I  was really surprized to read articles about it in wallstreet journal blogs or so. Here is a bunch of links that might be useful. Ofcourse that is not complete list, but might be good starting point for topic research.
